# wine_quality_regression_classification
This is a learning project where we conduct multiple methods of regression and classification on the same dataset to learn more about a wide range of methods and its use cases as well as the various aspects of a data science project including EDA, preprocessing, modelling etc. We will be using the dataset "Wine Quality" provided in UCI's Machine Learning repository for our work.  Our final aim is to be able to make prediction on the quality of wine given to us based on the parameters of our data set which will be done as two parts, one as classification where the integers from 0-10 as well as a binary classification of "excellent wine" and "average wine" are the classes for the quality of wine and the other part being regression where our final answer value can range from 0-10. This provides us the opportunity to get to know more about the various classification methods as well as regression methods. There are three files other than the readme. One is the jupyter notebook the work was done, there is also an html file which is the same as the jupyter notebook but converted. Feel free to use either of them for viewing the project. And finally, the csv file is the dataset we are working with.
This project is done python in google colab.
